  about: |
    Hey there! I'm Sam, I'm currently an Application Developer at IBM.

    I have a huge passion for technology and development, and love learning about all things code! I also enjoy teaching others about development and have previously been an instuctor for Code First: Girls in where I taught Python to a class of over 30 people, and I am currently part of a team at work creating a course to encourage more women into tech.

    My main focus is around modern JavaScript and making cool things on the web, as well as a love of Python and an interest in DevOps. Check out some of my projects personal below or get in touch in you'd like to chat about the work I do at my current position!
